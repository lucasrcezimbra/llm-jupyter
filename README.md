Run a IPython interpreter in the LLM virtual environment

## Installation

Install this plugin in the same environment as [LLM](https://llm.datasette.io/).
```bash
llm install llm-jupyter
```
## Usage

### IPython
This plugin adds a new `ipython` command to LLM. This executes IPython in the same virtual environment as LLM itself.

You can use this to check the Python version

```bash
llm ipython --version
# Should output '8.20.0' or similar
```

Or to start a IPython shell. In that shell you can import `llm` and use it to interact with models:
```bash
llm ipython
```

```python
In [1]: !llm 'Who are you?'
# Output: I am an AI digital assistant here to help you with any questions or tasks you may have. How can I assist you today?
```


### Notebook
This plugin also adds a new `notebook` command to LLM. This executes a Jupyter Notebook in the same virtual environment as LLM itself.

```bash
llm notebook
```

```python
!llm 'Who are you?'
# Output: I am an AI digital assistant here to help you with any questions or tasks you may have. How can I assist you today?
```

## Development

To set up this plugin locally, first checkout the code. Then create a new virtual environment:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:lucasrcezimbra/llm-jupyter.git
cd llm-jupyter
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .[test]
```
Now install the dependencies and test dependencies:
```bash
llm install -e '.[test]'
```
To run the tests:
```bash
pytest
```
